Here is my assignment submission.

## setup
Run these commands: 
1. ```pnpm install```
2. ```pnpm run build```

## usage
Open ```/src/index.html``` in your browser (I used the VSCode extension Live Server)

## final thoughts
Overall this is in great shape.

There are some small issues some pixels between the images and borders.

To improve this further, I would:
1. see if I can make better use of Bootstrap, or introduce jQuery, in order to resolve the extra pixel issues.
2. make the pink border size and icon size relative to screen width for better responsive design.

Thank you for reviewing my assignment!
